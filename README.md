This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, create a RapidAPI key here: https://rapidapi.com/developer/dashboard and create a ImagIn API key here: https://www.imagin.studio/car-image-api.
So, create a .env file filling NEXT_PUBLIC_RAPID_API_KEY and NEXT_PUBLIC_IMAGIN_API_KEY.

That`s it! Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
